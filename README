### Cheeseburger
    Delicious k/v db

### What's inside
- Memcached backend
- Writes on LevelDB
- Serialize with msgpack
- Replicates with ZMQ

So many awesome components that I had to name it cheeseburger.


- fetch memcached source code, engine-pu branch: https://github.com/memcached/memcached/tree/engine-pu
$ git clone -b engine-pu git://github.com/memcached/memcached.git memcached-engine-pu
$ cd memcached-engine-pu
$ ./config/autorun.sh
$ ./configure --prefix=/opt/memcached
$ make all install

- Test it
$ /opt/memcached/bin/memcached -E /opt//memcached/lib/memcached/default_engine.so

in a different term:

$ memcapable

All tests should pass. your memcached is ok and can switch backends.

$ cd leveldb_engine

Edit Makefile if you change memcached's include location

$ make clean all
$ /opt/memcached/bin/memcached -E redis_engine.so

in a different term

$ memcapable
